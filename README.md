# Shortest Path Map
Takes input of elevation data in .dat file and calculates grayscale range and values for each elevation point. Starting at each row, a greedy algorithm is used to calculate the path with the least change in elevation, which is then colored a light blue. Once this data is collected the row with the lowest distance value is colored a darker blue.
